# Obvious

The Obvious is a Raspberry Pi that runs the dictonary! We made this to act like the Ovilus which is used in various ghost hunting shows.  You will need an LED display and buttons. 


## Step 1:

Get a Raspberry Pi, LCD Display, and buttons. 



## Step 2:

Copy the `rc.local` file to here: `/etc/rc.local`

This is the file that will start up your program when you turn on your Raspberry Pi. It's a linux thing.
